          This tutorial explains how to use the <i>clustering</i> program
          provided at
          <a href="https://github.com/moldyn/Clustering"
            class="link link--light">
            github.com/moldyn/clustering
          </a>.
          A general introduction to the idea of dimensionality reduction and
          clustering
          can be found in
          <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5049637"

          The density-based clustering algorithm used in the module
          \(\mathtt{density}\) consists
          of four parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the free energy for each point based on the local point
            density.</li>
          <li>Scan the free energy landscape (from minimal to maximal value)
            and assign all points into geometrical clusters. If a point \(i\)
            is geometrically close to an existing cluster
            (\(d_{ij}\lt d_\text{lump}\)), it is assigned to it. Otherwise it
            forms a new cluster.</li>
          <li>Scan another time through the free energy to identify
            the seeds of microstates.</li>
          <li>The microstates are formed by assigning every point that is not
            yet part of a seed
            to its geometrically closest neighbor with lower energy. This
            guarantees that the
            barriers are cut at the edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each of these steps will be discussed in detail
          in the following.
          Afterwards we discuss two methods which improve the microstate
          definitions on the
          barriers, namely \(\mathtt{noise}\) and \(\mathtt{coring}\). Further,
          we present the most
          probable path algorithm (\(\mathtt{mpp}\)) to dynamically lump the
          microstates into macrostates.

        <h2 class="section__title">Preparing the data</h2>
        <p>
          Apply a suitable dimension reduction method (e.g. PCA) on the data and
          select a
          limited number of essential coordinates. For more information on PCA
          see
          <a href="https://moldyn.github.io/FastPCA">FastPCA</a>. It is
          important not to exceed the maximum dimensionality for the given
          sampling
          when using a density-based clustering approach.
          Too high dimensionality will suffer from the 'Curse of Dimensionality'.
          A good estimate, e.g. for a six dimensional data set is a sampling of
          \(\gt 10^6\)
          frames.</p>
        <p>
          The input data for the <i>clustering</i> package needs to be
          column-oriented,
          space-separated plain text. It is possible to use concatenated
          trajectory files.</p>
        <p>
          From now on, let's assume we have prepared input data for
          <i>clustering</i> in
          the file \(\mathtt{coords}\). Further, we assume that it is a single
          trajectory. Otherwise, the
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}\mbox{-}concat\mbox{-}limits}\) or
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}\mbox{-}concat\mbox{-}nframes}\) needs to be used
          in the steps \(\mathtt{noise}\) and \(\mathtt{coring}\).

          If you do not yet have suitable data, you download the example data
          set.

          Download the data, e.g., with \(\mathtt{wget}\), unpack it with
          \(\mathtt{bzip2}\) and create a symlink called \(\mathtt{coords}\) to
          be in line with
          the rest of the tutorial:

          If your computer is missing any of these programs, install them (or

          sysadmin do it). If they are not available, you are probably not able
          to install the package.

          The data consists of \(\sim 1.4 \cdot 10^6\) frames of a simulation of
          the
          peptide Aib9 (for more information on this data set, see <a

          neighbors</h2>
        <p>
          Other than k-means, this density-based clustering algorithms estimates
          the optimal seeds of the microstates. Those are regions with local
          high density representing local minima in the free energy landscape.
          Latter is calculated with
          $$
          G_{R}(\vec{r})= - \ln (P_R(\vec{r})/P_{R}^{\text{max}}),
          $$
          where \(P_{R}(\vec{r})\) is the local population at the point
          \(\vec{r}\) with respect to the sphere of radius \(R\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinate file named \(\mathtt{coords}\) is the only needed input
          for generating the free energy/ population and nearest neighbor files.
          This can be done simply by running:</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>

            href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5081767"
            class="link link--light">Nagel et al., 2019</a>
          it was shown that in most cases the lumping radius
          \(d_\text{lump}\) is a good choice for the clustering radius \(R\).
          Hence, we do not use the flag \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}r}\) here to set
          \(R = d_\text{lump}\). Nonetheless, in some cases (eg. if the sampling
          is relatively high and the dimensionality rather small) \(R\) should be
          chosen differently. It should be noted, that \(R\) and \(d_\text{lump}\)
          are in general independet variabels: while \(R\) needs to be small enough
          to ensure local constant density, \(d_\text{lump}\) determines only the
          desired level of coarse-graining.</p>
        <p>

          This code generates the population file \(\mathtt{pop}\), the free
          energy file \(\mathtt{fe}\) and the four column nearest neighbor file
          \(\mathtt{nn}\).

          This step is here only for pedagogical reasons. If we replace in the
          next step \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}D}\)/\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}B}\) with
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}d}\)/\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}b}\) we can achieve both
          steps within one.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Energy Screening - Generating Clusters</h2>
        <p>
          Before we explain the procedure, we want to note here that clusters do
          not correspond to states. Clusters just separate the space into
          geometrically connected regions. Those are per construction separated
          at the highest (considered) free energy, while states are separated at
          all barriers. At the highest free energy, when all trajectory points
          are considered, the main cluster usually contains up to \(90\%\) of
          all frames. This is illustrated in the following figure.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/clusterVsstates.png" alt="Generating clusters"
            class="fe-size">
        </figure>
        <p>
          Given the readily computed free energies (\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}d}\)) and
          neighborhoods (\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}b}\)) per frame for the selected
          radius, we continue the clustering by screening the free energy
          landscape. This means, we choose a (initially low) free energy cutoff
          \(\tilde{G}\) and select all frames below. They are combined into clusters,
          if they are geometrically connected with respect to the lumping
          distance \(d_\text{lump}=2\sigma\). The latter is automatically computed
          from the MD data. \(\sigma\) denotes here the standard deviation
          of the nearest neighbor distances. An illustration is provided in the
          following figures. If the threshold raises, previous clusters can be
          merged.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/generateClusters1.png" alt="Generating clusters"
            class="fe-size">
          <img src="figures/generateClusters2.png" alt="Generating clusters"
            class="fe-size">
          <img src="figures/generateClusters3.png" alt="Generating clusters"
            class="fe-size">
        </figure>
        <p>
          This is done repeatedly, with increasing free energy cutoffs. The end
          result will be multiple plain-text files, one for each cutoff, that
          define cluster trajectories. Their format is a single column of
          integers, which act as a membership id of the given frame (identified
          by the row number) to a certain cluster. For each file, the microstate
          ids start with the value 1 and are numbered incrementally. All frames
          above the given free energy threshold are denoted by \(0\), which acts
          as a kind of melting pot for frames with unknown affiliation.</p>
        <p>
          Do not worry if there are still frames denoted by \(0\) in the cluster
          file of the highest free energy. The <i>clustering</i> program rounds
          the maximum free energy to 2 decimal places for screening, which may
          result in a cutoff that is slightly lower than the true maximum. Thus,
          there may be frames left, which are not assigned to a cluster since
          they are not below the cutoff.</p>
        <p>
          However, since we are going to generate states from selecting the
          basins of the clusters and 'filling up' the free energy landscape from
          bottom to top, these states are not interesting on their own, anyhow,
          and will be assigned to a distinct state in the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinate file named \(\mathtt{coords}\), the previous generated
          free energy (\(\mathtt{fe}\)) and nearest neighbors (\(\mathtt{nn}\))
          files are all needed for generating the clusters. This can be done
          simply by running:</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>
                clustering density -f coords -T -1 -D fe -B nn -o cluster -v
             </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>With \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}T\ \mbox{-}1}\) the default screening step width
          of \(0.1\) is selected and \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}o\ cluster}\) sets the
          basename of the generated output files. If you do not have calculated
          the free energy file and the nearest neighbor yet, just substitute
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}D}\)/\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}B}\) with
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}d}\)/\(\mathtt{\mbox{-}b}\).

          In this step clusters (geometrically connected regions) are generated
          for all points below the free energy threshold, e.g., for
          \(\mathtt{cluster.2.6}\) all points with free energy \(\Delta G \le
          2.6\, \text{k}T\) are used. The files are single column files.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="js-section">
        <h2 class="section__title">Building a network</h2>
        <p>
          The net result of the screening process is a list of files (here:
          \(\mathtt{cluster.^*}\)) defining the cluster membership per frame for
          different free energy thresholds. Using these memberships, we can
          derive a network of microstates that reflects their respective
          geometrical similarity. The network has a (multi-)tree structure, with
          nodes defining separate microstates at the various free energy levels.
          In case two (or more) clusters grow big enough to be geometrically
          close, they will be merged into a single node at the free energy
          level, at which they are not distinguishable from a single state.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the metastable states of the free energy landscape are
          geometrically diverse enough, the network will form several trees in
          parallel, without them being joined at the highest free energy level.
          Of course, you can add a virtual root node at a free energy level
          above the maximum to join all trees into a single tree, however this
          has to be done manually. The <i>clustering</i> program will not
          artificially join the separate trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first step to get states out of the clusters. The idea is
          to identify local minima in the free energy landscape. Here we scan
          again through the free energy landscape.

          A cluster is accepted as node if it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> is geometrically disconnected to all accepted clusters (nodes)
          </li>
          <li> is not at highest free energy</li>
          <li> has a population higher than the minimal population
            \(P_\text{min}\)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The concept of minimal population \(P_\text{min}\) should be used
          carefully. It should only be used to remove local fluctuation within
          a minimum and not to lump close minima. Latter is non-physical and
          leads to bad defined states. If one is interested in macrostates a
          dynamical clustering method, e.g. MPP, should be used. In the 
          following figures we compare the number of resulting states \(k\)
          with the minimal population \(P_\text{min}\). To be comparable
          between different data sets, \(P_\text{min}\) is usually given in
          percent of the total number of frames. For obtaining this plot we
          used \(\mathtt{noise}\) with \(c_\text{min}=0.1\). </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/kofpmin_log.png" alt="k vs pmin" class="fe-size">
          <img src="figures/kofpmin.png" alt="k vs pmin" class="fe-size">
        </figure>
        <p>One should always choose an \(P_\text{min}\) value large enough to avoid
          the initial drop (shown in the first figure). Depending on the desired
          coarse-graining, one can pick a value in the range of
          \(P_\text{min}\in[4\cdot10^{-4}-0.2]\). In the following we take
          \(P_\text{min}=500\)</p>
        <p>
          Once we have the clusters, we need to generate states. The first step
          is to identify the local minima of the free energy landscape. This is
          achieved by running</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">

            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>The minimal population \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}p}\) should be selected high
          enough to guarantee that all local fluctuations are ignored, but no
          minima.</p>

      <section class="js-section">
        <h2 class="section__title">Generate a microstate trajectory</h2>
        <p>
          By defining the clustered trajectory of basin centers, we seed the
          clustering process with a limited number of microstates.
          The <i>clustering</i> program will use this information to assign
          all unassigned frames to one of these microstates.
          This is done by 'filling' the basins, i.e. starting at the
          unassigned frame of the lowest free energy, it will identify the

        <p>
          On the barriers we are facing a poor sampling. Therefore, also due to
          projection artefacts, frames can be assigned to the wrong state. To
          avoid this, we simply reassign those frames dynamically instead of
          geometrically. This was proposed in
          <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5081767"
            class="link link--light">Nagel et al., 2019</a>.
          We use the following definition of noise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All geometrically isolated clusters with population lower than
            \(\mathtt{c_\text{min}}\) are assigned as noise.</li>
          <li>They are assigned dynamically (in the sense of coring) to the
            previously visited state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where \(\mathtt{c_\text{min}}\) is given in percent of the total
          population. This has an impact of</p>
        <ul>
          <li>\(\approx5\%\) of total frames</li>
          <li>improves the Markovianity in some systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This all can be achieved by running</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Dynamical coring</h2>
        <p>
          Transitions between states usually do not occur in a direct and
          discrete manner.
          Rather, the system goes into a 'transition zone', where frames are
          alternating
          fast between two states before staying in the new state.
          These alternations severely change the dynamical description of the
          system and
          produce artificially short life times.
          You can use variable dynamic coring to correct for these boundary
          artifacts.
          Here, 'dynamic' means that we refer to the core of a state, if the
          system stays
          inside for a given amount of time (the so-called coring time). Thus, we check
          dynamic
          properties instead of geometric ones.</p>
        <p>
          To identify the optimal coring time \(\tau_\text{cor}\), run the
          coring-algorithm for several coring times and plot the probability
          \(W_i(t)\) to stay in state \(i\) for duration \(t\) (without
          considering back transitions). The optimal coring time is the lowest
          that matches an exponential decay.
          To produce probability distribution for different coring times,
          write a
          \(\mathtt{win}\) file with the content</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>
  * CORING_TIME
             </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>where \(\mathtt{CORING\_TIME}\) is the coring time given as number of
          frames.
          The star means, that we treat all states with the same coring time.
          Even though, the coring time can be specified separatly for all states, it
          is recommended to take a common time.

          Then run the command</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>
  clustering coring -s microstatesNoise -w win -d Wi -v
             </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          This produces several files of the format
          \(\mathtt{Wi\_CORING\_TIME}\).
          Repeat this process several times for different choices of coring time
          in the
          \(\mathtt{win}\) file.</p>
        <p>Remember that if you are using a concatinated trajectory you need to
          specify the limits by passing either
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}\mbox{-}concat\mbox{-}limits}\) or
          \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}\mbox{-}concat\mbox{-}nframes}\).</p>
        <p>
          After the generation of the probability \(W_i(t)\) files, we plot them
          (e.g. with matplotlib) and select the smallest window size that shows
          an exponential decay.
          In most cases it is sufficient to take the same window for all
          states. Select the window such that it shows an exponential decay for
          all microstates. In the following figures the probabilities for the first
          two states are shown,</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/coring.png" alt="finding coring time">
        </figure>
        <p>where we see that \(\tau_{cor}=4\,\text{frames}\) is sufficient.</p>
        <p>
          When you have selected proper windows sizes for all states, rewrite
          your
          \(\mathtt{win}\) file to reflect these. For three different states
          \(1, 2\,\&\,3\), e.g. you could write</p>

            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>for window sizes of 100 frames for state 1, 200 frames for state 2
          and 75
          frames for state 3.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, to produce the cored cluster trajectory, run</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>

        <p>If one wants to understand the effect of coring better, as a first

        <p> as well as for the uncored trajectory (\(\mathtt{microstates}\))
          This reveals that the metastability highly improves due to coring.
          It should be noted that if one wants to geometrically interpreted the
          final states one can use the \(\mathtt{filter}\) module. Therewith,
          one can get all frames of the input coordinates belonging to a certain
          state. This module is also capable of splitting xtc (gromacs)
          trajectories. Hence, if one uses the backbone dihedral angles to
          cluster, one can easily split also the MD trajectory to further
          investigate the states.</p>
        <p>For a geometrical interpretation of the states one can also use the

        <h2 class="section__title">Dynamical clustering - MPP</h2>
        <p>
          This method was proposed in <a
            href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp410398a"
            class="link link--light">Jain et al., 2014</a>. 
          To get a dynamical description of the state space, use the
          \(\mathtt{MPP}\) method to
          cluster the geometric microstates by their respective transition
          probabilities.
          This way, we identify the dynamically more stable from the less stable
          states.
          The most important parameter for MPP is the lagtime
          \(\tau_\text{mpp}\), which is - for the
          <i>clustering</i> program - always given in numbers of frames.
          The lagtime in units of time is trivially given by its value in
          numbers of
          frames multiplied by the time step of the underlying simulation.</p>
        <p>
          The lagtime is the amount of time (or number of frames) that is
          skipped when
          calculating transition probabilities from one state to another.
          In effect, timescales below the given lagtime are discarded and the
          dynamical
          clustering will only be able to describe processes of length higher
          than the
          given lagtime. It acts as a control parameter to blend out
          (uninteresting)
          processes on too short timescales and focus on processes of essential
          motion,
          which typically happen at longer timescales as the simulation
          stepping.</p>
        <p>
          Additionally, at a high enough lagtime the system will be
          approximately
          markovian, resulting in a discrete set of states well described by
          markovian
          dynamics.</p>
        <p>
          To run MPP, use the command</p>
        <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
          <pre class="code code--block">
             <code>
  clustering mpp -s microstatesFinal -D fe -l 25 -v
             </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p> where \(\mathtt{\mbox{-}l}\) is the lagtime in units of frames.</p>
        <p>
          The MPP run generates lots of new files, per default called
          \(\mathtt{mpp\_pop\_^*}\) and
          \(\mathtt{mpp\_traj\_^*}\). The star stands for the metastability
          (\(Q_\text{min}\)-value)
          of the run. The
          \(\mathtt{{}^*pop^*}\)-files hold the population information of the clusters
          for the given metastibility, while the \(\mathtt{{}^*traj^*}\)-files
          are the resulting cluster trajectories.</p>
        <p>
          The metastability value controls, how stable a state has to be to remain as
          single state. All states with a stability less then the given
          \(Q_\text{min}\)-value will be lumped according to their most probable state-path.</p><p>
          Let's assume from now on that the clustering resolution of choice is given at
          a metastability of 0.80. Thus, the clustered trajectory is in the file
          \(\mathtt{mpp\_traj\_0.80}\).</p>
